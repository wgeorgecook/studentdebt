		<h1>Yes, for some borrowers.</h1>
		<h3>President Biden <i>partially fulfilled</i> his campaign promise to forgive at minimum $10,000 for each American with student debt by limiting who qualifies for forgiveness.</h3>
		<p>With the repayment deadline looming, <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/biden-expected-cancel-student-loans-millions-us-borrowers-wednesday-2022-08-24"> President Biden announced student loan forgiveness</a> for borrowers making up to $120k. This order forgives $10k for single people, and $20k for Pell Grant recipients. Loan balances remaining will start repayment in January 2023.
		<p>See full announcement details <a href="https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/"> on the Federal Student Aid website</a>.

			<h3> Previous Articles </h3>
			<p>On December 22nd, the Biden administration announced an extension of the current deferral on student loan payments until <a href="https://twitter.com/POTUS/status/1473706456390291465?s=20"> May 1st, 2022</a>.</p>
			<p>However, President Biden is likely to reinstate payments after that date given <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/18/white-house-not-budging-student-loans-525357"> prior sentiments regarding blanket loan forgiveness</a>.</p>
			<p>With a looming May 1st deadline to reinstate student debt payments, the <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/03/14/1085707282/student-loan-payments-extension">Biden administration emailed guidance</a> to loan servicers to not reach out to borrowers.</a>
				This mid-March email comes at a time that loan servicers are legally required to touch base with borrowers before resuming payments.</p>
			<p>In an April 6th announcement, loan payments <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/06/biden-extends-payment-pause-on-federal-student-loans-until-september-.html">were suspended<a/> until at least September.</p>
